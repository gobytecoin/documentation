## What is GOBYTE?

GOBYTE is an ambitious project dedicated to the establishment of a truly decentralized Internet and its infrastructure.

## Key Features

+ High Throughput

With its consensus, GOBYTE has surpassed Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of TPS.

High TPS guarantees low calculation delay, speeding up transactions to parallel the velocity of existing payment systems such as VISA and SWIFT, which makes daily payment a possibility.
